# MLPowerSystem
In this project, two machine learning techniques, namely k-means clustering and k nearest neighbors classification (KNN classification), are applied to a test power network.

# Files
This project contains five files:
* Main.py: the main file used to run the project
* GUI.py: graphic user interface (GUI), generates graphic user interface and all its widgets.
* mlearninglib.py: machine learning library, contains k-means algorithm and KNN algorithm. This is used to execute the machine learning techniques
* timeseriessim.py: time series simulation, executes the time series simulation of the pandapower network and generates excel file for the simulation results (bus voltages and angles)
